# Robot Hand Movement Calibration

The robot data for the lab is taken generously from the TU Dortmund's Multiple Link Robot Arms Project http://www.rst.e-technik.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html. As part of the project, they have created an excellent public dataset: MERIt (http://www.rst.e-technik.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html#h3MERIt) -- A Multi-Elastic-Link Robot Identification Dataset that can be used for understanding robot dynamics. The data is from a three link robot

I will focus on predicting the current draw into one of the joints as a function of the robot motion. Such models are essential in predicting the overall robot power consumption.
